**Notes:**

* This workflow assumes you don't need the functionality provided by the App Center scripts you were previously using. If you do, you'll need to find alternatives or implement them yourself within the workflow.
* The comments within the steps indicate sections that might be unnecessary depending on your project's requirements. If you don't need tagging or postprocessing, you can remove those steps entirely.
* The upload step uses the `actions/upload-artifact` action to store the built APKs within your GitHub repository as an artifact. This allows you to download them later if needed.

Remember to adjust the paths and steps based on your specific project structure and build needs.
